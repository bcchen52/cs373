In order to run, compile all Java files...

`
javac Gate.java
javac Simulate.java
javac chen_p2.java
`

Then, run `chen_p2` with the original states and input string as command line arguments in the format...
`java chen_p2 <INITIAL_STATES> <INPUT STRING>`
    - The initial states string, ex. "LLLL" must have a length of 4

For example, running the tests in the assignment sheet...
`
java chen_p2 LLLL 1111
java chen_p2 LLLL 0000
java chen_p2 LLLL 01010101
java chen_p2 LLLL 10101010
`

This also works when changing the start states, assuming the first character is in {L, R, C} and the other three are in {L, R}.
